# PLEASE NOTE

If you are participating in Project Euler, **please do not** look at the code for problems you have not completed. This repository serves as a location for myself and potential employers to look over my coding abilities.

A lot of these problems were initially written in C++ but ported to Python if it didn't require the processing speed of C++ (some have both C++/Python solutions uploaded, but most do not have the C++ version uploaded here).
