An extra hour on a new boss, even if comp is optimal is still a learning experience.	For question 1, I answered in the middle because I want to kill bosses with fun people. I don't care about loot/achievements - I just want to have fun with people that I enjoy spending 9+ hrs/week with, and I think we've created that atmosphere here. I enjoy raiding with many of the raiders in Caustic.

Try to recruit more. There is no pressure to do your best and some people seem to be taking advantage of that.	Officers need to figure out a common goal that they agree on and present united front to the raid throughout progression

Discussing plans about our goals for the week prior to the actual raid night would be nice. As of late, the GMOTD has been really kept up to date and I love it! 	Overall, really happy with the people, officers, and progression within the guild! I would personally love adding a fourth day on some weeks during progression to help speed up the process. I know some people can't commit to that but it would be great if that could happen for at least the first few weeks of a new tier!

I'll share my ideas as appropriate.	Recruit another officer to help with responsibilities when one/two officers are gone. I believe that 4 is a better number to ensure that running the raid/guild doesn't overwhelm a single officer.	Overall, I think the guild is low drama and being run well. I would continue to give the guild members a voice and avoid group think.

Examples would be the seeming lack of willingness to push progression during the Botanist~ timeframe.  Following that, there was an extremely hard push to kill Gul'dan, extending 4 weeks.  I don't mind doing hard progression, but I would like to have the actual progression goals outlined directly.  One of the biggest small progression issues is the insistence of using the same composition, or saying 'we will do it for just a couple more pulls' with something that is not working.  While in some cases that is correct, I think that the 'pulling the trigger' on changing compositions or changing strategies needs to be made more quickly.  Generally when a suggestion about a new strategic choice happens, it takes between 5-25 more pulls before they are implemented.  When we are learning new fights, there should be more allowance for adjustments and potential changes to strats.  Sometimes feedback to the raid is very good.  Sometimes the feedback is nonexistant.  this is especially true on long progression fights (Botanist, Star Augur).  I think it would be helpful if we didn't have 10-20 pulls at a time where the officers have just had a tiff, and then no one talks at all for that period of time.  For progression in ToS.  I think on opening week we should clear M:NH at least through Elisande, so that the majority of players can get the skip.  After that we should focus solely on Tomb until we reach a comfortable point in progression and gearing so we can faceroll Gul'Dan for mounts.

None that i can think of. 	I felt like Guldan progression was slow, but i can't really point out one major thing that could have been improved. Roster consistency would have probably helped.

I think it was mainly because I joined you guys at an odd time. However I did enjoy how it made  me a better player. I also really liked how you guys included the social aspect as well. Considering people might be able to throw up number and do mechanics, If they're toxic AF they shouldn't be around. Anyway, cheers guys and looking forward to raiding with you in the future! -Dannon
